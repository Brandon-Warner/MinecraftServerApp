Tool takes .csv file containing Minecraft server urls in a single-column and returns data about each server from multiple endpoints.
Built with React, Material UI, Node.js, and Express library.

The data is specific people who look for blocked Minecraft servers -- the offline mode information lets the user know if the server is in 'offline' mode meaning the server is online, but not 'online'. 

To do: 
- create hover feature for the 'Offine?' button to display offline data from new third-party API
- more styling
