Tool takes .csv file containing Minecraft server urls and returns data about each server from multiple endpoints.
Built with React, Material UI, Node.js, and Express library.

The data is specific people who look for blocked Minecraft servers -- the offline mode information lets the user know if the server is in 'offline' mode meaning the server is online, but not 'online'. 

To do: 
- create hover feature for the 'Offine?' button to display offline data from new third-party API
- more styling
